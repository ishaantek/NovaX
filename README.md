## Self-hosting NovaX
You can run NovaX locally on your computer.

2. Unzip it, and open it in code.
3. Open the `index.html` file to start the website in a live server.

## Libraries used

- [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) - to create the functionality for the website.
- [Three JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) - to render the graphics and 3D objects on a canvas in the web browser.
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - for the scripted animation.
